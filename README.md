## My process

- Judge the design, think about the elements one needs
- Write HTML
- I chose to use `flex`, dividing the container into two items:
  - Image
  - Text
- The overall design is such that Desktop uses `row` direction, Mobile uses `column`

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

- Better usage of Flexbox
- Better positioning of the image
- Better overall thought process in consideration of the layout
